# Web Text Check
A pretty simple little utility for helping to verify that the text on a given web page meets a given rule.

# Why?
This is an offshoot of doing a lot of copy changes related to the
internationalization and localiztion of web applications. Ultimately at some
point you will need to verify that the copy presented is coming from your
localization source, which is a pain. Visually inspecting your pages can take
some time. With this tool, you can setup a pattern to match and then apply a
given class to anything that doesn't pass. This allows you to quickly visually
inspect a page for text that should be different.

# Use
Currently you'll have to clone the repo and load up the extension as a
temporary extenstion. Since it probably only works in Firefox, you should
[follow the
instructions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension#installing)
for that.

# Roadmap
Depends. If this continues to seem useful, I may try and flesh it out a little
better. Otherwise it might just die. Who knows.
